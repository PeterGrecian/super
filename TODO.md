# general thoughts

tidy repos.  Either add them to my website or delete them
use dotfiles more, you are always fiddling with .bashrc
choose one of cosmic-cycling or this

you can actually write the new version of play which was an animation player with multivariate loading from pre-rendered images

you can actually write an audio recorder for catching snorring

are there common patterns to android development which justifies a general-android repo?

the pull all repos script should be in here

maybe all TODOs should be here - its easier then to keep track of them

do i need a central slack repo for adding that facility to which ever apps want it?

maybe a central android app "alert me" for things which need to ring the alarm which runs in the background, so Berrylands can alert my phone

# super tools super/bin
* pull all repos, push all.  Concatenate all TODOs
* todo <repo> comment ; commit, push
